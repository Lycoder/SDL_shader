# SDL_shader
WIP header-only library for simple integration and usage of OpenGL/GLSL shaders on SDL2

**Warning**
This library is a WIP, and mostly unmantained, it was made only for personal usage, the code isn't really polished. If you want me to fix or change anything, go ahead and open an issue please!
